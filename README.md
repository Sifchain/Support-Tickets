# Support-Tickets
Here we can hendle support tickets raised from the community

This Doc aims at describing the procedure that is followed when dealing with Community issues.
It starts from a user interacting with a telegram support bot, and sends into a ticket into a support repository for the engineering teams.

# Telegram Bot

- User triggers the ticketsystem by typing /github_issue in a private chat with @sifbutler_bot 
- Bot asks user which category the issue belongs to
- Bot asks for a title for the issue
- Bot asks user to describe the issue by following the correspondent template (which can be found in this Support-Tickets repo)
- Bot thanks the user and send issue to the Sifchain Github Tickets telegram group

# Github Tickets telegram group

- CMs / DevRel try to replicate the issue
- CMs in the Private Support Group can accept or declines the issue (and the bot will notify the issue)
- If approved, the issue will be created in this Support-Tickets repo
- If CMs cannot successfully handle the issue, they tag DevRel on the issue
- If DevRel cannot successfully handle the issue they share the issue on Slack tagging the relevant engineering teams


# Closing the issue

- When issue is closed, the bot will notify the user. If needed CMs can handle communication with the affected user
